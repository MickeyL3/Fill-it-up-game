WELCOME TO FILL IT UP GAME!

The player will start the game by entering their name, choosing game difficulty modes
(easy – moderate – challenging). This setting changes the number of carts and the amount of the corresponding resource it takes to fill each one.
The player then selects the number of rounds to play from 5 to 15 rounds range and 3 types of Towers to start playing.
There are 5 different towers. Each tower has a different resource amount, reloading speed, resource type, level, and cost.
Next, the player will select a round difficulty before beginning the round. There are 3 round difficulty modes, which are Easy, Moderate, and Challenging.
This setting changes the speed of the carts on the track.
Now the gameplay begins.
To fill a running cart, the player must first use the Tower buttons at the bottom of the screen
to select a tower to shoot resources from. Next, the player will click on a cart that takes the same resource with the previously chosen tower.
This will add an amount of resource into the cart. Be aware that it takes a few seconds for the tower to recover as
each resource has different recovery time, so that it can fire again.
After winning the first round, the player will be rewarded points and can be converted to coins, The player then can spend it in the Shop.
There are multiple buy Towers and upgrade options in the Shop. After winning the first round, there is a possibility that the player's towers
will randomly break and disappear from their inventory.
